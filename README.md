Tech Stack:<br>
  ✔️HTML<br>
  ✔️CSS<br>
  ✔️Javascript<br>
  🔥Firebase<br>
    🔥firebase realtime database<br>
    🔥firebase Authentication using webpack <br>

Problem:<br>
I dont have any personal projects on my resume or github to show employers that i can do what i said i can do<br>
Also going into this project I (currently) dont know how to use firebase realtime database & firebase authenication with there webpack<br>

Solution:<br>
Build a web app! As a passionate jiu jitsu practioner of course it had to be a jiujitsu tracking app<br>

MVP:<br>
1️⃣app must have the ability to authenticate new & current users<br>
2️⃣tracking training sessions <br>
  ◼️days trained<br>
  ◼️number of rounds trained<br>
  ◼️minutes of each round<br>
  ◼️submissions hit each training session<br>
3️⃣App will display<br>
  ◼️calender with indicator of which days you trained in the current/past month(s)<br>
  ◼️stats with the percentage of of total submissions you hit<br>
  ◼️current belt rank<br>
  ◼️stats of how often you train Gi vs Nogi<br>
